<H2><FONT COLOR="OLIVE" FACE="Times New Roman">DEFINITION</FONT></H2>
<p> A plant disease is a process that occurs over time that alters a plant's normal functions, appearance, or physiological state. It can be caused by a living or non living entity, and can reduce the quality and yield of the plant's harvested product<BR>
Plant pathology or phytopathology is the scientific study of plant diseases caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors).</p>

<H2><FONT COLOR="OLIVE" FACE="Times New Roman">TYPES OF PLANT DISEASES</FONT></H2>
<p> Plant diseases are classified primarily by their causative agents, which can be divided into two categories:<BR></p>
<H3><FONT  COLOR="BRONZE" FACE=""> BIOTIC OR INFECTIOUS DISEASES:</FONT></H3>
<p> These diseases are caused by living organisms. They are called plant pathogens when they infect plants. For the purposes of discussing plant pathology, only plant disease pathogens will be discussed. Pathogens can spread from plant to plant and may infect all types of plant tissue including leaves, shoots, stems, crowns, roots, tubers, fruit, seeds and vascular tissues .</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman"> ABIOTIC OR NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES:</FONT></H3>
<p>These diseases are caused by conditions external to the plant, not living agents. They cannot spread from plant to plant, but are very common and should be considered when assessing the health of any plant. Examples of abiotic diseases include nutritional deficiencies, soil compaction, salt injury, ice, and sun scorch.</p>

<img src="INFECTIOUS.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="styled-image" alt="INFECTIOUS " > 
 <img src="NON INFECTIOUS.jpg"width="250" height="250" class="styled-image" alt="NON INFECTIOUS " >
</div>

<H2><FONT COLOR="OLIVE" FACE="Times New Roman">CAUSES </FONT></H2>
<p> There are several types of organisms that cause plant diseases. These include fungi, bacteria, viruses, host:</p> 

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">FUNGI:</FONT></H3>
<p>Tiny, simple plants called molds, generally measured in microns. No chlorophyll; depends on other organisms or plant tissues for food. Multiply by spores which produce threadlike filaments that enter the host directly or through natural openings.<BR>
<B> Advantages:</B>  Fungi are important contributors to the soil carbon stock.<BR>
<B> Disadvantages:</B>  Fungi create harm by spoiling food, destroying timber.</p> 

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">BACTERIA:</FONT></H3>
<p> Small, one-celled organism, measured in microns .Lack chlorophyll, cannot produce its own .Reproduced by cell division every 15-20 minutes.<BR>
<B> Advantages:</B>  Protecting them from disease and improving their growth.<BR>
<B> Disadvantages:</B>  leaf spots and blights, soft rots of fruits, roots, and storage organs, wilts, overgrowths, scabs, and cankers.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">VIRUSES:</FONT></H3>
<p> plant viruses can have a significant negative impact on plants by causing a wide range of symptoms including discolouration, distortion and loss of vigour and yield. .<BR>
<B> Advantages:</B conferring tolerance to drought, cold and hot soil temperatures.<BR>
<B> Disadvantages:</B> discolouration, distortion and loss of vigour and yield.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">HOST:</FONT></H3>
<p> A host is a plant that can become infected by a pathogen. Not all plants are susceptible to attack from the same pathogen as some pathogens have preference for certain plants.<BR>
<B>Advantages:</B> promoting microbes in defense mechanism against insects and herbivores.<BR>
<B> Disadvantages:</B> water scarcity, structural challenges, and the risk of desiccation </p>

<H2><FONT COLOR="OLIVE" FACE="Times New Roman">HISTORY</FONT></H2>
<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">Ancient Practices:</FONT></H3>
<p>Humans have known that plants can become diseased, with subsequent losses in food quantity or quality, for centuries. Early references to plant diseases can be found in the Old Testament of the bible, in the book of Kings, for example, and early Indian, Sumerian and Roman references to plant disease can be found that date back to 2000 bc.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">Modern Development:</FONT></H3>
<p>These plant pathologists were also influenced by parallel developments in the causes of human and animal diseases, and saw clear similarities between their work with plants and fungi when compared to the works of Louis Pasteur and Robert H. Koch. Modifications of Koch’s postulates are still used in plant pathology to determine if an organism actually causes a given disease.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="BRONZE" FACE="Times New Roman">Current Trends:</FONT></H3>
<p> Plant diseases pose a serious threat to agricultural production and food security. The annual loss of crop yield due to plant diseases is estimated to be more than 30% globally, worth hundreds of billions of dollars .Diseases not only directly lead to crop reduction but also reduce the quality and value of agricultural products, increase agricultural inputs and labor costs, and affect farmers’ income and livelihood .<br><br></p>

<p>We accepted our hypothesis that the plants would grow towards sunlight and in the their needed conditions.It is very necessary to inform people about all the diseases , their symptoms and their treatments and most important thing is how to prevent them.Decisions that are based on reliable and accurate information increases the quality of farming.Plant diseases can be managed by using resistant varieties, treatment with pesticides, and, less, in other ways.</p>
